### ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND (Prioritized by Impact)

#### **P0 - CRITICAL** (Blocks Mobile Usability)

**None found** - No blocking issues for Tuesday demo

---

#### **P1 - HIGH PRIORITY** (Degrades Mobile Experience)

**1. Touch Target Violations - Multiple Instances**
- ❌ **"Add Client" button**: Height = 35px (needs 44px minimum)
  - Location: /clients page, top-right corner
  - Impact: Difficult to tap accurately, especially with gloves or larger fingers
  - Fix: Increase height to 48px, add padding

- ❌ **Sort/Filter controls**: All 35px height
  - Location: /clients page header (Name, Ascending/Descending, Tier filter)
  - Impact: Accidental mis-taps when trying to sort
  - Fix: Standardize to 44-48px touch targets

- ❌ **Search bar**: Height = 35px
  - Location: All pages with search functionality
  - Impact: Hard to tap into search field on first try
  - Fix: Increase to 48px minimum, add comfortable padding

**Estimated Fix Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Priority for Demo:** HIGH (but not blocking)

---

**2. Typography Below Mobile Readability Standards**

- ❌ **Tier badges**: Font size = 10.5px (needs 12px minimum)
  - Location: Client cards, messaging sidebar
  - Impact: Hard to read at arm's length
  - Fix: Increase to 12px, adjust badge padding accordingly

- ❌ **Brand preference badges**: Font size = 10.5px
  - Location: Client cards ("OMEGA", "IWC", etc.)
  - Impact: Squinting required to identify brands
  - Fix: Increase to 12px

- ❌ **Metric card subtitles**: Font size varies (10-14px)
  - Location: Dashboard analytics cards
  - Impact: Inconsistent visual hierarchy
  - Fix: Standardize to 14px for primary labels, 12px for secondary

- ❌ **H3 headings inconsistent**: Ranging from 12.25px to 14px
  - Location: Card titles across all pages
  - Impact: Weak visual hierarchy
  - Fix: Standardize H3 to 16px (1rem)

**Estimated Fix Time:** 20-30 minutes
**Priority for Demo:** MEDIUM (acceptable if time-constrained)

---

#### **P2 - MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Polish Issues)

**3. Minor Visual Inconsistencies**

- ⚠️ **"3 errors" notification** appearing in bottom-left of waitlist page
  - Likely a console error or dev warning leaking to UI
  - Fix: Debug and remove error notification
  - Time: 10-15 minutes

- ⚠️ **Analytics card spacing** slightly uneven on mobile
  - Some cards have 16px padding, others 12px
  - Fix: Standardize to 16px padding across all metric cards
  - Time: 5-10 minutes

- ⚠️ **Long client names** may truncate awkwardly
  - Example: "Richard Blackstone" shows fully, but longer names might wrap
  - Fix: Add text-overflow: ellipsis with tooltip on hover
  - Time: 15-20 minutes

---

#### **P3 - LOW PRIORITY** (Nice-to-Haves)

**4. Enhancement Opportunities**

- 💡 **Swipe gestures**: Could add swipe-to-archive on waitlist entries
- 💡 **Pull-to-refresh**: Standard mobile pattern for updating data
- 💡 **Haptic feedback**: Already implemented (triggerHapticFeedback utility exists)
- 💡 **Loading skeletons**: Could add skeleton loaders for better perceived performance
- 💡 **Empty states**: Add illustrations to "No clients found" messages

**Estimated Fix Time:** 1-2 hours (optional for later iteration)
