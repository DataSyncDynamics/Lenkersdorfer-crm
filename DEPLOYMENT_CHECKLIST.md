## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

### If Authentication Issues Occur

1. **Check Supabase Status:**
   - Visit https://status.supabase.com/
   - Verify no outages

2. **Verify Environment Variables:**
   - Check Vercel dashboard
   - Confirm variables are set correctly
   - Redeploy if needed

3. **Check User Creation:**
   - Verify demo user exists in Supabase
   - Check "confirmed_at" is not null
   - Try creating user again

4. **Review Logs:**
   - Check Vercel function logs
   - Check browser console
   - Check Supabase logs

5. **Emergency Fix:**
   - If needed, temporarily disable middleware
   - Allow access without auth
   - Fix issues
   - Re-enable authentication

---

## Success Criteria

### Deployment is Successful When:
- âœ… Build completes without errors
- âœ… Login page loads on production URL
- âœ… Demo user can log in successfully
- âœ… Session persists after page refresh
- âœ… All routes are protected
- âœ… Sign out works correctly
- âœ… Mobile experience is smooth
- âœ… No console errors
- âœ… Jason successfully logs in
- âœ… Jason provides positive feedback

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

### Current State
1. **No Password Reset:**
   - If demo password is forgotten, must be reset in Supabase Dashboard
   - Future: Implement forgot password flow

2. **No User Profile:**
   - "Jason Jolly" link in sidebar is not clickable yet
   - Future: Add user profile page

3. **Single Demo User:**
   - Only one demo account for now
   - Future: Add ability to create multiple users

4. **No Email Verification:**
   - Auto-confirm is enabled for demo
   - Production should enable email verification

### Not Issues (By Design)
- Login page is not accessible when logged in (auto-redirects)
- No "Remember Me" checkbox (always remembers)
- No social auth (email/password only)
- No sign-up page (admin creates users)

---

## Next Features to Implement

### Priority 1 (Next Sprint)
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] User profile page
- [ ] Change password functionality
- [ ] Account settings page

### Priority 2 (Future)
- [ ] Multi-user support with roles
- [ ] Row Level Security policies
- [ ] Email verification flow
- [ ] Activity logs

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Social authentication (Google, Microsoft)
- [ ] Two-factor authentication
- [ ] Remember device
- [ ] Login activity tracking
