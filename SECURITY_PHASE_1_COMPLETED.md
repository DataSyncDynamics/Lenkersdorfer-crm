# Phase 1 Security Remediation - COMPLETED

## Execution Date: October 22, 2025

---

## CRITICAL ALERT: CREDENTIAL ROTATION REQUIRED

**SECURITY INCIDENT DETECTED:** The `.env.local` file was committed to git history on October 17, 2025 (commit: 23739fce12c29ea9a955bd1abc9fdc094ad76af0).

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. **Rotate Supabase Credentials Immediately:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/
   - Navigate to Project Settings > API
   - Click "Generate New Anon Key" (this invalidates the exposed key)
   - Update the service role key as well (best practice)
   - Update `.env.local` with new credentials
   - Update Vercel environment variables with new credentials

2. **Review Supabase Logs:**
   - Check for any unauthorized access attempts
   - Review all database operations from October 17-22, 2025
   - Look for suspicious activity patterns

3. **Post-Rotation Steps:**
   - Test the application with new credentials
   - Verify all team members have updated credentials
   - Monitor for 24-48 hours for any issues

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Authentication Enabled ✅

**File:** `/Users/dre/lenkersdorfer-crm/src/lib/supabase/client.ts`

**Changes:**
- Changed `persistSession: false` to `persistSession: true`
- Added `autoRefreshToken: true`
- Added `detectSessionInUrl: true`
- Configured localStorage for session storage

**Impact:** Sessions now persist across page refreshes. Users will remain logged in.

---

### 2. Secrets Removed from Version Control ✅

**File:** `/Users/dre/lenkersdorfer-crm/vercel.json`

**Changes:**
- Removed the entire `build.env` section containing:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

**Note:** These must now be set in Vercel Dashboard under Environment Variables.

---

### 3. Environment Variable Template Created ✅

**File:** `/Users/dre/lenkersdorfer-crm/.env.example`

**Purpose:**
- Provides template for new developers
- Documents required environment variables
- Includes security warnings about service role key

**Usage:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Then fill in actual values
```

---

### 4. Authentication Added to Import Endpoints ✅

#### File: `/Users/dre/lenkersdorfer-crm/src/app/api/import/lenkersdorfer/route.ts`

**Security Additions:**
1. User authentication check (401 if not authenticated)
2. Role-based access control (403 if not manager/admin)
3. Uses `createServerSupabaseClient()` with proper cookie handling

**Protected Actions:**
- CSV file upload
- Client data import
- Purchase history creation

#### File: `/Users/dre/lenkersdorfer-crm/src/app/api/clients/batch-import/route.ts`

**Security Additions:**
1. User authentication check (401 if not authenticated)
2. Role-based access control (403 if not manager/admin)
3. Uses `createServerSupabaseClient()` with proper cookie handling

**Protected Actions:**
- Batch client import
- Bulk purchase creation

---

### 5. Authentication Middleware Created ✅

**File:** `/Users/dre/lenkersdorfer-crm/src/middleware.ts`

**Functionality:**
1. **Session Management:**
   - Automatically refreshes expired sessions
   - Handles cookie updates properly
   - Uses `@supabase/ssr` for Next.js App Router compatibility

2. **Public Endpoints (No Auth Required):**
   - `/api/health`
   - `/login`
   - `/signup`
   - `/auth/callback`
   - `/_next` (Next.js static files)
   - `/favicon.ico`
   - `/static`

3. **Protected API Routes:**
   - All `/api/*` routes (except public endpoints)
   - Returns 401 if not authenticated

4. **Protected Pages:**
   - `/dashboard/*`
   - `/clients/*`
   - `/inventory/*`
   - `/waitlist/*`
   - Redirects to `/login?redirect=[original-path]` if not authenticated

---

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test the following:

### Authentication Tests
- [ ] Unauthenticated users cannot access `/dashboard`
- [ ] Unauthenticated users cannot access `/clients/*`
- [ ] Unauthenticated users redirected to `/login`
- [ ] Login redirects back to original page
- [ ] Session persists after page refresh
- [ ] Session expires and redirects after timeout

### API Security Tests
- [ ] `/api/import/lenkersdorfer` returns 401 without auth
- [ ] `/api/clients/batch-import` returns 401 without auth
- [ ] Non-admin users get 403 on import endpoints
- [ ] Admin users can successfully import data

### Role-Based Access Tests
- [ ] Create test user with 'salesperson' role
- [ ] Verify they get 403 on import endpoints
- [ ] Create test user with 'manager' role
- [ ] Verify they can access import endpoints
- [ ] Create test user with 'admin' role
- [ ] Verify they have full access

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying:

1. **Rotate Supabase Credentials** (CRITICAL)
   - [ ] Generate new anon key
   - [ ] Generate new service role key
   - [ ] Update `.env.local` locally
   - [ ] Update Vercel environment variables

2. **Vercel Configuration**
   - [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` in Vercel
   - [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Vercel
   - [ ] Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in Vercel
   - [ ] Set environment variables for Production, Preview, and Development

3. **Database Setup**
   - [ ] Ensure `profiles` table exists in Supabase
   - [ ] Ensure `profiles.role` column exists
   - [ ] Create test users with different roles
   - [ ] Verify Row Level Security (RLS) policies are active

4. **Testing**
   - [ ] Complete all items in Testing Checklist above
   - [ ] Test deployment in Vercel preview environment
   - [ ] Verify environment variables loaded correctly

---

## Next Steps (Phase 2+)

The following security items remain for future phases:

### Phase 2: Row Level Security (RLS)
- Implement RLS policies in Supabase
- Prevent cross-salesperson data access
- Enforce manager-only access to sensitive data

### Phase 3: Advanced Security
- Add rate limiting to API routes
- Implement audit logging for sensitive operations
- Add CSRF protection
- Implement session timeout controls

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Alerts
- Set up Supabase monitoring
- Configure alerts for failed auth attempts
- Track suspicious activity patterns
- Log all import operations

---

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### For Unauthenticated Users:
- Redirected to `/login` when accessing protected pages
- API calls return 401 status
- Cannot import data

### For Authenticated Salespeople:
- Can access dashboard and client pages
- Cannot access import endpoints (403 Forbidden)
- Session persists across page refreshes

### For Authenticated Managers/Admins:
- Full access to all features
- Can import CSV data
- Can perform batch operations
- All actions are now authenticated

---

## Support & Documentation

### For Questions:
- Review this document
- Check `.env.example` for required variables
- Refer to Supabase documentation: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** "Unauthorized - Authentication required"
**Solution:** User needs to log in. Check session is being saved.

**Issue:** "Forbidden - Manager or Admin role required"
**Solution:** User's role in `profiles` table needs to be updated to 'manager' or 'admin'.

**Issue:** Build fails in Vercel
**Solution:** Ensure all environment variables are set in Vercel Dashboard.

---

## Conclusion

Phase 1 security remediation is **COMPLETE** with one critical follow-up action required:

**CRITICAL:** Rotate Supabase credentials due to git history exposure.

Once credentials are rotated, the Lenkersdorfer CRM will have:
- ✅ Proper authentication enabled
- ✅ No secrets in version control
- ✅ Protected import endpoints
- ✅ Role-based access control
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ API route protection

The application is now significantly more secure and ready for production deployment.
