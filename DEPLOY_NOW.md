# DEPLOY NOW - Critical Production Fix

## Status: READY TO DEPLOY ✅

All code changes are committed and ready for deployment.

---

## What Was Fixed

**Issue:** "Missing Supabase environment variables" error on production

**Solution:** Centralized environment configuration with build-time validation

---

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (RECOMMENDED)

```bash
# Push to GitHub (triggers Vercel deployment automatically)
git push origin main

# Then go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
# Watch the deployment complete
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment (If you have Vercel CLI)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

---

## After Deployment

### 1. Verify Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
→ Select "lenkersdorfer-crm" project
→ Settings → Environment Variables

**Ensure these are set for ALL environments (Production, Preview, Development):**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://zqstpmfatjatnvodiaey.supabase.co`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

**If NOT set:**
1. Click "Add New"
2. Enter variable name and value
3. **IMPORTANT:** Check ALL THREE boxes: Production, Preview, Development
4. Save
5. Trigger a NEW deployment (redeploy won't work - must rebuild)

### 2. Monitor Deployment

Watch build logs for:
```
✓ Environment Variable Verification
✓ All required environment variables are set
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Build completed
```

### 3. Test Production

1. Visit: https://lenkersdorfer-crm.vercel.app/
2. Should see login page (NOT error page)
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Should NOT see "Missing Supabase environment variables"
5. Log in with:
   - Email: `demo@lenkersdorfer.com`
   - Password: `LuxuryWatch2024!`
6. Should redirect to dashboard
7. Refresh page - should stay logged in

---

## If You See "Missing Supabase environment variables" After Deployment

This means environment variables were NOT available at build time.

### Fix:

1. **Verify variables are in Vercel settings**
   - Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Must be set for ALL environments

2. **Trigger a FRESH deployment**
   - Do NOT use "Redeploy" button
   - Make a small change and commit OR
   - Go to Deployments → Latest → click "Redeploy" → check "Use existing build cache" = OFF

3. **Check build logs**
   - Look for "Environment Variable Verification" section
   - Should show "✓ SET NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL"
   - Should show "✓ SET NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
